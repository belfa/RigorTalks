Humbug has completed the initial test run successfully.
Tests: 8 Line Coverage: 76.00%
Humbug is analysing source files...
Mutation Testing is commencing on 4 files...
(.: killed, M: escaped, S: uncovered, E: fatal error, T: timed out)
......M.S.....M
15 mutations were generated:
      12 mutants were killed
       1 mutants were not covered by tests
       2 covered mutants were not detected
       0 fatal errors were encountered
       0 time outs were encountered

Metrics:
    Mutation Score Indicator (MSI): 80%
    Mutation Code Coverage: 93%
    Covered Code MSI: 86%

Remember that some mutants will inevitably be harmless (i.e. false positives).
